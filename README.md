**VideoStar**

A video sharing platform where users can view a variety of short videos fetched from a third party API. Videos may be either free or priced where free videos can be
favorited and watched, while priced videos are blurred and can be added to a cart where they can be purchased or removed. Purchased videos assume the same functionality
as free videos.
